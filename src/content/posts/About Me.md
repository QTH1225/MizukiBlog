Here is **Tianhao Qin (秦天浩)**.<br>

I am a graduate student in the School of Mechanics & Civil Engineering at the China University of Mining and Technology (CUMT), advised by [Prof. Shiping Yin ](https://cace.cumt.edu.cn/info/1201/15167.htm), within [Green Materials and Building Industrialization Theory and Research Team](https://cace.cumt.edu.cn/info/1479/31679.htm). Before joining this team, I have conducted research on China's carbon peak and carbon neutrality goals, as well as machine learning, with [AP Yaning Qiao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gxVZszAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).<br>

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at - 02210632@cumt.edu.cn

## Research Interests

**I am looking forward to learning from scholars in different fields around the world. If you are interested in my research, please contact me!**

- [Green Materials and Building Industrialization Theory and Research](https://cace.cumt.edu.cn/info/1479/31679.htm)
- Concrete Structure Reinforcement and Repair
- New Concrete Materials (FRP, TRC, UHPC, etc.)
- Applied Machine Learning

My current research focuses on durability of reinforced concrete in coastal area and reinforcement measures. I am interested in the application of  **New Building Materials**(such as FRP, TRC) and **Intelligent Algorithm** (such as machine learning and neural networks) in concrete structures. In short, the new green building materials have a positive impact on everyone's life. I wish to devote my talent to this meaningful cause and bring well-being to society.
